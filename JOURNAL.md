i actually dont remember spending this much time on this until i looked at the time. tdy i finished the pcb, ran the checks and it looks good. used the plugin and it made my life 50% easier. routing lowkey had me stressing out, im not sure if its supposed to be so messy. i prolly shoudlnt have spent so long on something like this T_t ---
ADDED cute silkscreen!!! I hope everything with the pcb is done so i can suffer with the case :p

chat im already planning my next project nd i havent even finished this one * sob * gosh oh okay so today i routed the pcb again and its so embarrassing how messy it is. like i hope that it just *works*. then i cried over autofusion, and then i finally figured how i was going to make it!! kinda. i want it to be gasket mounted, and thankfully i dont have to put screws in the pcb for that, but i'd i have to look more into it. there are some really goated YT videos im following and im learnin a lot. i finally extruded the plate to 5mm, part of it is cut by 1.5 so the switches can click. im a little unsure about the top part of the case and how im going to get the exact measurements for the knob and oled. i honestly dont want to touch kicad for the rest of the week lol
