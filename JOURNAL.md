i actually dont remember spending this much time on this until i looked at the time. tdy i finished the pcb, ran the checks and it looks good. used the plugin and it made my life 50% easier. routing lowkey had me stressing out, im not sure if its supposed to be so messy. i prolly shoudlnt have spent so long on something like this T_t ---
ADDED cute silkscreen!!! I hope everything with the pcb is done so i can suffer with the case :p
