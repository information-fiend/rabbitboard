i actually dont remember spending this much time on this until i looked at the time. tdy i finished the pcb, ran the checks and it looks good. used the plugin and it made my life 50% easier. routing lowkey had me stressing out, im not sure if its supposed to be so messy. i prolly shoudlnt have spent so long on something like this T_t ---
ADDED cute silkscreen!!! I hope everything with the pcb is done so i can suffer with the case :p

i rlly should be working on this more often, wanna finsih this so i can get to other stuff T_T. decided to re-route the pcb and am getting jealous at other people's boards on reddit. ueeerrrggh oh a problem im running into is that the pcb is way too big for the plate.. getting the measurements right is turning out to be v difficult. tears shed: 20.5

*LOG #007:* 
chat im already planning my next project nd i havent even finished this one * sob * gosh oh okay so today i routed the pcb again and its so embarrassing how messy it is. like i hope that it just *works*. then i cried over autofusion, and then i finally figured how i was going to make it!! kinda. i want it to be gasket mounted, and thankfully i dont have to put screws in the pcb for that, but i'd i have to look more into it. there are some really goated YT videos im following and im learnin a lot. i finally extruded the plate to 5mm, part of it is cut by 1.5 so the switches can click. im a little unsure about the top part of the case and how im going to get the exact measurements for the knob and oled. i honestly dont want to touch kicad for the rest of the week lol

how do i do stuff. cut out stuff for the knob and oled, took a nap (not counted in time lol), made the walls for the case. most of this time was planning how i was even going to build the case. i was going to do a tray mount orginally but wanted it to sound decent. going for a gasket mount.

HOW DO SCREWS WORK??? why am i doing math for this seemingly simple design... super confused how im going to do the top part of the case. im thinking of putting the gasket material on the purple things, extend the plate on those edges.. if that makes sense. gonna remake the walls. its very much slowly falling tg. i just wanna be done w this soo i can submitttt.

TO-DO:
* make BOM
* make the QMK (or KMK idk yet)
* upload files for CAD
* contemplate life and my existence in it
* put feet on the bottom of case
* update readme

ngl i dont feel time passing when i work on this, so its weird writing up what i did. its fun looking back at the journal tho!! i came pretty close to redoing the case itself. like reallly close. decided that the plate was just going to sit atop the bottom part instead of being screwed in. the top case had some errors, but i hopefully solved them. i heard someone say when you make a mistake in crochet, it gives it personality. i was applying the same thing here to make myself feel better lol
all i do is yap here, so here's some measurements:
* countersink for screw: 3.6x1.5mm
* screw shaft: 2mm
* height of entire thing: 23mm
* width of bunny head: 104mm
